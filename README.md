# Tic-Tac-Toe
My first ever tic-tac-toe game! I was very proud!


In the main I FORGOT TO comment out most the things, SO LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY. 
IF U WANT TO COPY ANY OF THIS CODE TO YOUR OWN PROJECT, IT WORKS VERY WELL AND FAST, SO YOU CAN DO THAT, BUT YOU NEED TO
KNOW THAT IN THE MAIN.JAVA CLASS, THE ONLY THING YOU NEED IS ACTUALLY THE main method. 
All the other methods don't matter to the GUI. I was testing with text first, that why and didn't comment it out, so ye.

It's my first REAL project, and I did it near years eve just worked all day with it, so be gentle with me! 
I think it works very good though so ye and the GUI looks good.
